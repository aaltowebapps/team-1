
Branching model:
* Develop features in a feature branch
* Integrate to the branch "develop"
  - Unit tests must pass
  - New features may be disabled when they are not yet usable, all enabled features should be usable.
* Keep the branch "master" stable
  - Same as the "develop" branch, but also test tested on the target device.

Development practices:
* Avoid duplicate code
* Do not add generated code to the repository
* Have a consistent and good style
* Cover code that should not break with unit tests
* Use common sense when available
